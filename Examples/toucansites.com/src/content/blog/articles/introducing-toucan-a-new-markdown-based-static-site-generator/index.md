This exciting project is set to revolutionize the way you create and deploy websites, making the process faster, easier, and more secure than ever before. Here’s a closer look at what makes Toucan the perfect choice for your web development needs.

## What is Toucan?

Toucan is a cutting-edge static site generator designed to help you build fast, secure websites with minimal effort. Leveraging the power of Swift, Toucan allows you to create and deploy beautiful, high-performance sites effortlessly. 

Here’s what sets Toucan apart:


## Markdown-based

Toucan makes content creation a breeze with its seamless Markdown integration. Markdown’s simple syntax allows you to focus on writing content without getting bogged down in complex HTML. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Markdown's intuitive format makes it easy to create and edit your site’s content.

## Built using Swift 

At the heart of Toucan is Swift, a modern programming language known for its speed and efficiency. By building Toucan with Swift, we’ve ensured that our static site generator runs efficiently and reliably, allowing you to create static sites quickly and safely.

## Custom Themes

**Professional theme store is coming soon later this year.**

With Toucan, you will have access to a range of customizable themes that make designing your website straightforward and enjoyable. Our templates are built with modern web standards in mind, ensuring that your site looks great on all devices and platforms. You can easily modify and adapt these templates to suit your specific needs, giving you full control over your site’s design and layout. Templates are built using the Mustache format.


## Free Hosting on GitHub Pages


One of the most exciting features of Toucan is its seamless integration with GitHub Pages, providing you with a completely hosting-free solution. Once your site is ready, you can deploy it directly from your GitHub repository with just a few commands (**coming soon later this year**). This eliminates the need for costly hosting services and simplifies the deployment process, allowing you to focus on creating great content.
