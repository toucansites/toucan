            <itunes:summary>Welcome to part four in the AWS Certification Exam Prep Mini-Series! Whether
                you're an aspiring cloud enthusiast or a seasoned developer looking to deepen your
                architectural acumen, you've landed in the perfect spot. In this six-part saga, we're
                demystifying the pivotal role of a Solutions Architect in the AWS cloud computing cosmos.

                In this fourth episode, Caroline and Dave chat again with Anya Derbakova, a Senior Startup
                Solutions Architect at AWS, known for weaving social media magic, and Ted Trentler, a Senior
                AWS Technical Instructor with a knack for simplifying the complex. Together, we will step
                into the realm of performance, where we untangle the complexities of designing
                high-performing architectures in the cloud. We dissect the essentials of high-performing
                storage solutions, dive deep into elastic compute services for scaling and cost efficiency,
                and unravel the intricacies of optimizing database solutions for unparalleled performance.
                Expect to uncover:

                • The spectrum of AWS storage services and their optimal use cases, from Amazon S3's
                versatility to the shared capabilities of Amazon EFS.
                • How to leverage Amazon EC2, Auto Scaling, and Load Balancing to create elastic compute
                solutions that adapt to your needs.
                • Insights into serverless computing paradigms with AWS Lambda and Fargate, highlighting the
                shift towards de-coupled architectures.
                • Strategies for selecting high-performing database solutions, including the transition from
                on-premise databases to AWS-managed services like RDS and the benefits of caching with
                Amazon ElastiCache.
                • A real-world scenario where we'll navigate the challenge of processing hundreds of
                thousands of online votes in minutes, testing your understanding and application of
                high-performing AWS architectures.

                Whether you're dealing with vast amounts of data, requiring robust compute power, or
                ensuring your architecture can handle peak loads without a hitch, we've got you covered!

            <itunes:summary>In this insightful episode, we're joined by Dave Stauffacher, Chief Platform
                Engineer at Direct Supply and an AWS Community Hero, renowned for his expertise in cloud
                engineering and data storage. Dave will be one of our speakers in the AWS Community track at
                re:Invent 2023 this year, and he shares his remarkable journey of migrating a massive
                20-terabyte file system, encompassing over 1 billion files, to Amazon FSx for Windows File
                Server with a mere 2 hours of downtime.

                Beyond the technical, Dave's role in nurturing the local developer community is equally
                inspiring. As the co-founder of the Milwaukee Hashicorp User Group and an active participant
                in various tech groups, he is deeply invested in sharing his knowledge and experiences. His
                contributions to industry events and the AWS Storage Blog reflect his commitment to
                educating others.

                Join us as we explore all things data and cloud with a true industry leader and learn how
                you can get involved in your local developer community. There may even be some Harry Potter
                math talk!

                Lead at Riot Games, and Ashwin Raghuraman, Senior Solutions Architect at AWS supporting Riot
                Games. Dive into the dynamic world of Riot Games, the creative force behind iconic titles
                like League of Legends (LoL) and Valorant.

                Discover Riot's innovative approach to reshaping the gaming experience with Riot Direct.
                This initiative has revolutionized the way Riot collaborates with Internet Service
                Providers, moving from traditional 'hot-potato routing' to intelligent packet routing. This
                shift significantly reduces player ping times, a critical factor in competitive esports
                gaming. We also explore Riot Games' strategic move to the cloud, particularly their adoption
                of Kubernetes, which marks a transformative step in their game development process. This
                transition not only streamlines operations but also opens up new horizons for innovation and
                agility in game creation.

                In a groundbreaking move, Riot Games has introduced 'Voice Toxicity Tech' to foster
                healthier, more inclusive gaming communities. This episode delves into how this technology
                combats negative behavior, ensuring a respectful and enjoyable environment for all players.
                Join us as we discuss how Riot Games is leveraging cloud technology to redefine game
                development and create extraordinary player experiences today!

                with tech luminary Pete Erickson. The duo dive into the essence of connection and
                authenticity in the tech world, exploring the pivotal role of developer relations and the
                resilience of the industry from the dot-com bust to the present. Pete shares his rich
                experiences and insights, painting a vivid picture of the tech landscape's evolution,
                including the rise of voice technology and Conversational AI.

                This episode is more than a technological exploration; it's a celebration of the enduring
                human spirit and the power of genuine connections in shaping our industry. As we reminisce
                about the significant milestones and innovations of 2023, Pete and Dave engage in a profound
                discussion about the future, particularly the exciting potential of Generative AI and Large
                Language Models. This episode is a testament to the importance of learning, adapting, and
                the magic that happens when people connect, share, and grow together. Tune in for an
                inspiring look back at the year gone by and a hopeful gaze into the promising horizon of
                2024, where technology and human connection converge to create a brighter future.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Linda and Dave welcome back Alyssa Lee, Senior Go-To-Market
                (GTM) Specialist - Customer Success (AI / ML) at Amazon Web Services.

                The world of development is rapidly changing, and so is the definition of a 'developer'.
                Dive into this enlightening episode as we explore the fast-paced evolution of AI technology
                and its profound impact on the developer experience. From the rise of Generative AI to the
                game-changing Amazon CodeWhisperer, discover how real-time code recommendations are
                revolutionizing productivity.

                Alyssa, our expert in Customer Success, sheds light on the transformative power of natural
                language in coding, making it as simple as chatting with a friend. As low-code solutions
                gain traction, where does GenAI fit in? And with these advancements, who really is the
                developer of today and tomorrow?

                Tune in to explore the future where creativity meets code, and everyone can be a developer!

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Dave and Emily catch up with Elad Ben-Israel, CEO at Wing
                Cloud and original creator of the AWS CDK.

                Winglang is new programming language and toolchain designed for the cloud from the ground
                up. It gives developers a unified way of accessing their cloud infrastructure and code using
                a single language, while still being able to run and test inside a local simulator for high
                speed iterations.

                Elad takes on a historical journey to the original creation of the AWS CDK, the shift from
                coding for single machines to modern distributed cloud-based systems, the power of open
                source, and the continued evolution of writing software. There may even be an analogy to
                burning man and building software as a community.

            <itunes:summary>Join us in this insightful episode as we welcome back the inimitable Brian
                Tarbox, an AWS Community Hero and Alexa Champion, whose expertise is steeped in over thirty
                years of hands-on experience in the tech industry. With an impressive track record that
                includes ten patents, a slew of papers under his belt, and the co-leadership of the Boston
                AWS Meetup, Brian's insights are nothing short of invaluable.

                In this lively and engaging conversation, Emily, Dave, and Brian traverse the burgeoning
                landscape of technological terminology, exploring how definitions and interpretations have
                evolved over time. Specifically, they delve into the concept of &quot;Serverless&quot; - a
                term that, like many in our industry, has undergone significant transformation since its
                inception. What does Serverless mean in 2023? Brian, with his deep knowledge and candid
                demeanor, unpacks this in a way that is both easy to grasp and thought-provoking.

                This episode is not just a feast for your ears, but also a metaphorical banquet, as Brian
                masterfully utilizes metaphors to bring clarity to these often-complex concepts. It's a
                lively and humorous ride through the often-puzzling labyrinth of tech jargon, punctuated by
                heaps of fun and laughter.

                So, whether you're a seasoned tech veteran or a curious newcomer, tune in to this episode
                and savor the knowledge-rich discussion between Emily, Dave, and Brian. Be prepared to
                laugh, learn, and see the tech world through a fresh lens. It's an episode you won't want to
                miss!

                how to effectively leverage both in your cloud architecture. Alex also uncovers the mystery
                of AWS Serverless Connectors, giving us an exclusive walkthrough that can help you

                because in this episode, your hosts Linda and Dave are joined by a luminary in the field,
                Alyssa Lee, an AI/ML Customer Success Lead at Amazon Web Services. Alyssa, who is on the
                frontline of developer productivity, will pull back the curtain on her team's strategy as
                they work with the Builder's Experience Portfolio (BEX). Ever wondered what goes on behind
                the scenes? Alyssa brings us front row to the theatre of AI/ML application, sharing
                captivating, real-life customer stories from the trenches. This isn't just about the AI hype
                – it's about practical tools and solutions that are revolutionizing the industry today.
                Alyssa shines her expert spotlight on three core areas where AI/ML is redefining efficiency:
                AIOps (AI for Operations), AIDev (AI for Development), and AISec (AI for Security). Ever
                heard of observability? Alyssa will spell it out and explain why it's an ace up the sleeve
                for ensuring customer success.

                Finally, Alyssa will share the triumphs and tribulations customers are experiencing in the
                brave new world of AI/ML. You won't want to miss these insights that could be game-changers
                for your own developer journey. So, plug in, tune out the world, and prepare to have your
                mind expanded in this riveting episode.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Linda, Emily, and Dave chat with Jon Handler, Sr. Principal
                Solutions Architect at AWS, and Ashok Thirunarayanan, Senior SDM, Search Service at AWS.
                Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is an on-demand serverless configuration for Amazon OpenSearch
                Service. Serverless removes the operational complexities of provisioning, configuring, and
                tuning your OpenSearch clusters. It's a good option for organizations that don't want to
                self-manage their OpenSearch clusters, or organizations that don't have the dedicated
                resources or expertise to operate large clusters. With OpenSearch Serverless, you can easily
                search and analyze a large volume of data without having to worry about the underlying
                infrastructure and data management. Jon and Ashok cover how they built OpenSearch
                Serverless, how they think about search technology and removing complexity, how developers
                can get started with this new feature, and what has got them excited about the future of
                search.

                InfluxData. InfluxData are the makers of InfluxDB, a popular open-source platform for
                simplifying time series data management. Designed to handle high speed and high volume data
                ingest and real-time data analysis, InfluxDB's robust data collectors, common API across the
                entire platform, highly performant time series engine, and optimized storage lets you build
                once and deploy across multiple products and environments. Jay shares his journey to the
                cloud, gives us a developer introduction to time series data management, how to compare it
                to relational data and databases, how developers should think about this kind of data, and
                shares some real world customer success stories.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Emily and Dave chat with Jason Yee, Staff Technical
                Evangelist at Datadog. Datadog is an essential monitoring and security platform for cloud
                applications offering end traces, metrics, and logs to help make your applications,
                infrastructure, and third-party services entirely observable. Jason covers how developers
                can best think of observability, the helpful tenants of LIFT (latency, errors, traffic, and
                saturation), and how to get started today. Jason also gives an overview of Graviton
                processors, an analysis of cost and performance, and how Datadog has been able to generate
                massive cost savings through a service migration to ARM.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Brooke and Dave chat with Caroline Gluck, Senior Cloud
                Application Architect at AWS. Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) is an
                approach to IT operations that uses machine learning and other forms of artificial
                intelligence to automate and optimize various IT processes. It can help improve the
                efficiency, agility, and reliability of IT operations by reducing the time and effort
                required to detect and resolve issues, improving the accuracy of predictions and
                decision-making, and enabling faster response times to changes and incidents. Caroline walks
                us through her cloud journey, what AWS services can help with AIOps, and offers real-world
                scenarios of how AWS customers are using AIOps today.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Emily and Dave chat with Keyur Diwan Sr. Product Manager,
                Amazon RDS. Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed
                services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud. Amazon
                RDS recently launched fully managed Blue/Green Deployments to help you with safer, simpler,
                and faster updates to your Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS databases. Blue/Green Deployments
                create a fully managed staging environment that allows you to deploy and test production

            <description>In this episode, Emily and Dave chat with Keyur Diwan Sr. Product Manager, Amazon
                RDS. Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed services
                that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud. Amazon RDS
                recently launched fully managed Blue/Green Deployments to help you with safer, simpler, and
                faster updates to your Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS databases. Blue/Green Deployments create
                a fully managed staging environment that allows you to deploy and test production changes,
                keeping your current production database safe. With a single click, you can promote the
                staging environment to be the new production system in as fast as a minute, with no changes
                to your application and no data loss. Keyur walks us through this new feature, how to get

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Dave is joined by special co-host Linda Haviv, and Vin Yu,
                Sr. Product Manager – Tech at Amazon Web Services. Amazon DocumentDB is a MongoDB
                compatible, fully managed native JSON document database, that makes it easy and cost
                effective to operate critical document workloads at virtually any scale. Vin shares his
                journey to the cloud, gives insights on the Product Manager -Tech role at Amazon, and covers
                recent updates to Amazon DocumentDB. During re:Invent 2022, Vin's team also announced Amazon
                Document DB Elastic Clusters, enabling the ability to elastically scale your document
                database to handle virtually any number of writes and reads. Vin walks us through what this
                announcement means for developers and how to best get started using it today.

                then discusses the re:Invent 2022 launch of RDS Optimized Writes, which can help improve
                write throughput by up to 2x at no additional cost. RDS Optimized Writes is especially
                useful for MySQL customers with write-intensive database workloads, commonly found in
                applications such as digital payments, financial trading, and online gaming.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Dave chats with Vaibhav Khandelwal, Sr. Technical Product
                Manager for AWS DMS. The AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) helps customers securely
                migrate their databases to AWS with minimal downtime. Since 2016, AWS DMS has migrated more
                than 800,000 databases and currently supports over 20+ database and analytics engines.
                Vaibhav’s team recently launched the AWS DMS Schema Conversion service, which streamlines
                database migrations by making schema assessment and conversion available directly inside AWS
                DMS. Vaibhav walks us through an overview of DMS, how developers can get started with this
                new managed service, and what his team is focusing on delivering next.

                Manager for AWS Appsync. AppSync is a managed service that helps simplify data access, and
                the creation of scalable GraphQL APIs. Brice walks us through everything new in Appsync for
                developers post re:Invent 2022! This includes the ability to now write GraphQL APIs using
                JavaScript, the availability of two new libraries, and a new test API to simplify local
                development and testing.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Emily and Dave chat with Namrata Shah, Managing Director,
                PwC, about all things DevOps. Namrata has over two decades of consulting experience where
                she managed very large Developers teams. In this episode she shares her DevOps journey
                through the years, what developers look for in the real world around DevOps, what an ideal
                DevOps Tool would be that doesn’t exist today, and what the future of AIOps, NoOps, and
                DevOps itself might look like.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Emily and Dave chat with John Dalton, Sr. Product Manager,
                Amazon RDS Open Source, and Jonathan Katz, Principal PMT, Amazon RDS Open Source, about the
                recent launch of Trusted Language Extensions PostgreSQL. Trusted Language Extensions for
                PostgreSQL is an open source development kit for building PostgreSQL extensions that allows
                developers to build high performance PostgreSQL extensions and safely run them on your RDS
                for PostgreSQL DB instance. By using Trusted Language Extensions (TLE) for PostgreSQL,
                developers can create PostgreSQL extensions that follow the documented approach for
                extending PostgreSQL functionality. Both Johns discuss building this new service update, and
                their approach to open source.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Dave and Emily chat with Srinivas Iragavarapu, Sr. SDM for
                Amazon CodeWhisperer. Designed to improve developer productivity, Amazon CodeWhisperer
                provides machine learning (ML)–powered code recommendations to accelerate development of C#,
                Java, JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript applications. The service integrates with multiple
                integrated development environments (IDEs), including JetBrains (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and
                WebStorm), Visual Studio Code, AWS Cloud9, and the AWS Lambda console, and helps developers
                write code faster by generating entire functions and logical blocks of code—often consisting
                of more than 10–15 lines of code. Srinivas discusses the recent re:Invent 2022 developer
                preview launch, how the team built Code Whisperer, and how developers can take advantage of
                the service today.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Emily and Dave chat with Harry Mower, GM for AWS DevOps
                Tools, and Doug Clauson, Principal Product Manager Technical for AWS DevTools. Amazon
                CodeCatalyst is a unified software development and delivery service, that enables software
                development teams to quickly and easily plan, develop, collaborate on, build, and deliver
                applications on AWS, reducing friction throughout the development lifecycle. Harry and Doug
                walk us through this new product announcement, how the idea for a unified developer
                environment started inside AWS, how their team thinks about developer experience, lessons
                learned building such a product, and how you can get started with Amazon CodeCatalyst today.

                for AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda SnapStart for Java offers up to 10x faster function startup
                performance at no extra cost. Lambda SnapStart is a performance optimization that makes it
                easier for you to build highly responsive and scalable Java applications using AWS Lambda,
                without having to provision resources or spend time and effort implementing complex
                performance optimizations. Tarun walks us through what this new feature means for
                developers, how the Lambda team was able to create such improved performance, and how
                developers can enable it today.

                Amazon Web Services. Danilo shares his journey from online trainer, solutions architect, to
                the Chief Evangelist at AWS for EMEA. Amazon Web Services is focused on powering all
                operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and committed to achieving Amazon's goal of
                net-zero carbon by 2040. Danilo shares what this initiative means from a developer
                perspective, including specific advice across AWS services, and the importance of
                observability to understand the sustainability of your own modern applications.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Emily and Dave chat with Cobus Bernard, Sr Developer
                Advocate, Technical Experience at AWS. Cobus talks about his experience moving from Africa
                to the United States, the tech scene in Africa, and what it was like working in developer
                relations with such a diverse geography. Cobus then dives into an introduction to using
                Terraform on AWS, understanding HCL and modules, and shares some of the gotchas developers
                might run into.

                Engineer at Bolt, and an AWS Machine Learning Hero. In this episode, Francesco dives deep in
                the ML tools on AWS, starting with the tools such as NVIDIA Triton and TensorRT, and how to
                improve processing time for Computer Vision. He also covers Amazon SageMaker, and many other
                AWS ML services as well as deploying ML models using Docker in the best way possible. If you
                missed it, you could listen to part one of this conversation in Episode 045.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Dave chats with Nader Dabit, Developer Relations Engineer at
                Edge &amp; Node. In his career, Nader has worn the hats of a web developer, mobile
                developer, AWS cloud developer, and now Web3 developer. Nader is the author behind many of
                the popular, free, developer guides for the Web3 space including: The Complete Guide to Full
                Stack Web3 Development, The Complete Guide to Full Stack Ethereum Development, and The
                Complete Guide to Full Stack Solana Development. In part two of this two-part conversation,
                Nader explains the developer lessons he has learned moving from Web2 vs Web3, some of the
                misconceptions about Web3, and what Web3 can bring to people around the world.

                Note: This episode is an attempt to cover the developer benefits of Web3. It does not
                represent financial advice, or any specific Amazon endorsement of Bitcoin and Crypto

            <description>In this episode, Dave chats with Nader Dabit, Developer Relations Engineer at
                Edge &amp; Node. In his career, Nader has worn the hats of a web developer, mobile
                developer, AWS cloud developer, and now Web3 developer. Nader is the author behind many of
                the popular, free, developer guides for the Web3 space including: The Complete Guide to Full
                Stack Web3 Development, The Complete Guide to Full Stack Ethereum Development, and The
                Complete Guide to Full Stack Solana Development. In part two of this two-part conversation,
                Nader explains the developer lessons he has learned moving from Web2 vs Web3, some of the
                misconceptions about Web3, and what Web3 can bring to people around the world.

                Note: This episode is an attempt to cover the developer benefits of Web3. It does not
                represent financial advice, or any specific Amazon endorsement of Bitcoin and Crypto
                Currencies.

            <itunes:summary>In this episode, Dave chats with Nikhil Swaminathan, Sr. Manager, Product
                Management at AWS Amplify, to discuss AWS Amplify Hosting. AWS Amplify Hosting is a fully
                managed CI/CD and hosting service for fast, secure, and reliable static and server-side
                rendered apps that scale. It supports many modern web frameworks including React, Angular,
                Vue, Next.js, Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, and more. Nikhil covers how AWS Amplify Hosting can help
                developers, how to get started, and examples of how customers are using it today.

                Amazon Web Services. Kevin owns a unique space within AWS Developer Tools where his team
                thinks about the developer tool chain, and what AWS can build for developers in 2023 in
                beyond. This research combines quantitative data, usability testing, observation, and
                anecdotes to bridge the gap between engineering teams and customer feedback. Along the way,
                Kevin discusses breaking down the tasks developers need to go through (over 65 have shown up
                in research so far) from idea to production, and how AWS hopes to simplify the process.

            <description>In this episode Dave chats with Elad Ben-Israel, Principal Engineer at Amazon Web
                Services for the Cloud Development Kit (CDK). In part one of this two-part conversation,
                Elad talks about his time as a software engineer at Amazon, the creation of the Cloud
                Development Kit, and the philosophy behind JSII, a new framework that allows code in any
                language to naturally interact with JavaScript classes.
