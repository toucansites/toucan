description: "This episode dives into the Amazon Bedrock Converse API, a new release that simplifies integrating large language models (LLMs) into your applications.

We talk with Dennis from the AWS Developer Experience team about how Converse tackles common integration challenges, and explores the concept of tools for unlocking new orchestration capabilities for LLMs.

By the end, you'll be equipped to get the most out of foundation models on Amazon Bedrock."
